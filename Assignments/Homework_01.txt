+The escape room theme that i gravitated towards the most was the “Escape the Bank”. 
It reminded me of the popular game “PayDay2” (Where the players are bank robbers). 
In the game there is a timer displayed on the overhead of the u.i. 
An idea that came to mind regarding “Escape the Bank” was synchronized watches. 
The purpose of the watches would serve to add another element of immersion and add to the anxiety/stakes at hand.
The watches could be made of two things, the first being 3-d printed materials or the latter which would be modded old broken watches.
The watches would be different colors to give a more a a game based feel.(p1 red watch, p2 blue, p3 green, p4 yellow)The watches would all be synced up via software, so that all players would be able to see the time remaining, whether it be increased/decreased due to in game events.
The display would be comprised of either LED’s or some digital display, the only constraint that might limit the project would be the budget, but with the help of research alongside the internet there is most likely an affordable alternative. 
Another idea that stood out that i felt that could be implemented were the glass combined with the lenses made of a special filter that is found in computer monitors.
The glasses frames could be 3-d printed or “borrowed” from the local movie theaters.
The frames would be plain black. 
I figured a way to implement the glasses would be a way of accessing a bank vault of sorts through a computer terminal, 
but the monitor would only be visible if players had the glasses.
